expr   :term ((PLUS|MINUS) term)*

term   :factor ((MUL|DIV) factor)*

factor :INT|FLOAT

Pretty basic stuff but from what I researched, this would be enough for basic  arithmetic operations.

If I had a string implementation included, perhaps it would look something like this:

atom   : INT|FLOAT|STRING|
